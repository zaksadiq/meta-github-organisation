# meta-github-organisation
# Meta Repository for the On-Going Organisation Project of `zaksadiq`'s Github Repositories.
This is a 'meta' repository hosting Project Management Organisation towards the clear and structured organisation of `zaksadiq`'s repositories on Github.
## Deliverables
Let us measure progress as a function of how close we are to the intended output and objectives.
### Output
We would like to see:
- A github account finished, (read: polished), ready and worthy of presentation as a portfolio in a job-interview context, and to showcase `zaksadiq`'s skills and capability, to be a principal key in opening doors, as an 'opportunity magnet'. 
- A portfolio suite of projects. These shall:
  - Primarily, initially, come from previous-projects not currently hosted on github.com.
  - Come with their own README files and Screenshots / GIFs.
  - Later, come from on-going work towards amassing assorted 'skills broadening' projects, e.g. from identifying key personal and side-projects which will contribute towards a particular career path.
